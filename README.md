## About

This is a powerful, elegant web application framework that simplifies common tasks for web projects, including routing, dependency injection, job processing, and real-time event broadcasting.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Composer**: Install from [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
- **PHP**: Ensure PHP 7 or higher is installed.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```
composer install
```

```
npm install 

npm run dev

npm run build
```

## Step 4: Set Up the Environment

**Copy the Environment File**:
  ```
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
**Generate an Application Key**:
  ```
  php artisan key:generate
  ```

## Step 5: Setup the Database

If your project includes database seeding, you can populate your database with default values by running:

**Migrate Database**:
  ```
  php artisan migrate
  ```

**Seed Database**:
  ```
  php artisan db:seed
  ```

**Banner Seeder**:
  ```
  php artisan db:seed --class=BannerSeeder
  ```

**Order Detail Seeder**:
  ```
  php artisan db:seed --class=OrderDetailSeeder
  ```

**Order Seeder**:
  ```
  php artisan db:seed --class=OrderSeeder
  ```

This command will run all the database seeders defined in your project.

## Step 6: Serve Your Project

Start the development server with:

```
composer run dev
```

Access your project at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
